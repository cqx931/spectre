        <div>
          <h1>SPECTRE PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

          <h2>Spectre leverages exciting new technologies to personalize our content and derive valuable insights for you! When you interact with Spectre, you're trusting us with your data. We understand this is a big responsibility and we want to reassure you that we value the private nature of your data.</h2>

          <p>This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can manage your information.</p>
          <p>Spectre represents a range of services that derive unique intuitions about millions of people each day, helping them to better explore and interact with the world.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>INFORMATION SPECTRE COLLECTS</h1>

          <h2>We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</h2>
          <p>We collect data to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which information you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most, or which videos you might like to watch. The information Spectre collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how those services use you.</p>

          <h2>Things you create or provide to us</h2>
          <p>When you create a Spectre Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and email. Even if you aren’t using Spectre we may allow you to provide us with this information — to receive updates, for example, about our services.</p>
          <p>We also collect the content you create or upload when using our services. This includes things like the choices you make when interacting with Spectre and any photos of you that are created during your experience.</p>

          <h2>Information we collect as you use our services</h2><br/>

          <p>If you choose to interact with Spectre after the exhibit, we may collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use, in order to provide you with a better user experience.</p>
          <p>The information we may collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version numbers. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>
          <p>We collect this information when your device contacts our servers — for example, when you login to Spectre's post-experiences resource site.</p>

          <h3>Your activity</h3>
          <p>We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like choose videos you might like to see. The activity information we collect may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interface choices you make</li>
            <li>Videos you watch</li>
            <li>Views and interactions with other users</li>
            <li>Voice and photographic information</li>
            <li>Other Spectre users with whom you interact</li>
            <li>Your page history as you move through the interface</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you use Spectre to send or receive messages, we may collect log information like your calling-party login, receiving-party login, time and date of messages, duration of interactions, routing information, and types of messages.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>WHY SPECTRE COLLECTS DATA</h1>
          <h2>We use data to build better services</h2>
          <p>We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
          <h3>Provide our services</h3>
          <p>We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the data you provide in order to better craft your unique experience.</p>
          <h3>Maintain &amp; improve our services</h3>
          <p>We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which pages are most popular across our services.</p>
          <h3>Develop new services</h3>
          <p>We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Spectre’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Spectre Photos.</p>
          <h3>Provide personalized services, including content and ads</h3>
          <p>We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized results. For example, <span >Spectre Checkup </span>provides tips adapted to how you use Spectre products. And <span >Spectre Play</span> uses information like videos you’ve watched to suggest new videos you might like.</p>
          <p>Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized content based on your interests. For example, if you are a certain type of user,  you may get to interact with other users that are similar to you. You may be able to control what information we use by visiting your personal data settings.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We won’t show you personalized content which represents sensitive topics, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</li>
            <li>We don’t share information that personally identifies you with any third-parties, such as your name or email.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Measure performance</h3>
          <p>We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Spectre Analytics. When you visit sites that use Spectre Analytics, Spectre and a Spectre Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
          <h3>Communicate with you</h3>
          <p>We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to Spectre from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Spectre, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>
          <h3>Protect Spectre, our users, and the public</h3>
          <p>We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, financial risks, and technical issues that could harm Spectre or the public.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. </p>
          <p>We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above, or in order to improve Spectre’s services and the content delivered by Spectre.</p>
          <p>If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Spectre Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
          <p>We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS</h1>
          <h2>You may have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</h2>
          <p>This section describes controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit Spectre's <span >Privacy Checkup</span>, which provides an opportunity to review important privacy-related information. In addition to these tools, we may also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our <span >Product Guide</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
          <h2>When you share your information</h2>
          <p>Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Spectre Search.</p>
          <p>When you’re signed in and interact with some Spectre services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing an app in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in <span >ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting</span>.</p>
          <h2>When Spectre shares your information</h2>
          <p>We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Spectre except in the following cases:</p>
          <h3>With your consent</h3>
          <p>We’ll share personal information outside of Spectre when we have your consent. For example, if you <span >use Spectre Home to make a reservation </span>through a booking service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your name or phone number with the restaurant. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.</p>
          <h3>With domain administrators</h3>
          <p>If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Spectre services (like G Suite), your <span >domain administrator </span>and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Spectre Account. They may be able to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email</li>
            <li>View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install</li>
            <li>Change your account password</li>
            <li>Suspend or terminate your account access</li>
            <li>Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request</li>
            <li>Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>For external processing</h3>
          <p>We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.</p>
          <h3>For legal reasons</h3>
          <p>We will share personal information outside of Spectre if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our <span >Transparency Report</span>.</li>
            <li>Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.</li>
            <li>Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.</li>
            <li>Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Spectre, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.</p>
          <p>If Spectre is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>KEEPING YOUR INFORMATION SECURE</h1>
          <h2>We build security into our services to protect your information</h2>
          <p>All Spectre products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.</p>
          <p>We work hard to protect you and Spectre from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit</li>
            <li>We offer a range of security features, like <span >Safe Spaces</span> and <span >Security Verification </span>to help you protect your data</li>
            <li>We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems</li>
            <li>We restrict access to personal information to Spectre employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>EXPORTING &amp; DELETING YOUR INFORMATION</h1>
          <h2>You may be able to export or deleta a copy of the information that Spectre has collected</h2>
          <h2>Retaining your information</h2>
          <p>We retain the data we collect for different periods of time depending on what it is, how we use it, and how you configure your settings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Some data you may be able to delete whenever you like.</li>
            <li>Other data is deleted or anonymized automatically after a set period of time</li>
            <li>And some data we retain for longer periods of time when necessary for business or legal purposes, such as security, fraud and abuse prevention, or financial record-keeping.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you delete data, we follow a deletion process to make sure that your data is safely and completely removed from our servers or retained only in anonymized form. We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.</p>
          <p>You can read more about Spectre’s <span >data retention periods</span>, including how long it takes us to delete your information.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>COMPLIANCE &amp; COOPERATION WITH REGULATORS</h1>
          <p>We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.</p>
          <h2>Data transfers</h2>
          <p>We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain <span >legal frameworks </span>relating to the transfer of data, such as the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>
          <p>When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h1>ABOUT THIS POLICY</h1>
          <h2>When this policy applies</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Spectre and its affiliates. This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to services that have separate privacy policies that do not incorporate this Privacy Policy.</p>
          <p>This Privacy Policy doesn’t apply to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The information practices of other companies and organizations that advertise our services</li>
            <li>Services offered by other companies or individuals, including products or sites that may include Spectre services, be displayed to you in search results, or be linked from our services</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>We change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We always indicate the date the last changes were published and we offer access to <span >archived versions </span>for your review. If changes are significant, we’ll provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of Privacy Policy changes).</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Customizing our services</h2>
          <p>For example, we may display a special Spectre icon on the homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.</p>
          <h2>Affiliates</h2>
          <p>An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Spectre group of companies, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Spectre Ireland Limited, Spectre Commerce Ltd, Spectre Payment Corp, and Spectre Dialer Inc. Learn more about the <span >companies providing business services in the EU</span>.</p>
          <h2>Algorithm</h2>
          <p>A process or set of rules followed by a computer in performing problem-solving operations.</p>
          <h2>Application data cache</h2>
          <p>An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.</p>
          <h2>Browser web storage</h2>
          <p>Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.</p>
          <h2>Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
          <p>A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function</p>
          <p>properly without cookies. Learn more about <span >how Spectre uses cookies </span>and how Spectre uses data, including cookies, <span >when you use our partners' sites or apps</span>.</p>
          <h2>Device</h2>
          <p>A device is a computer that can be used to access Spectre services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.</p>
          <h2>Non-personally identifiable information</h2>
          <p>This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually- identifiable user.</p>
          <h2>IP address</h2>
          <p>Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.</p>
          <h2>Pixel tag</h2>
          <p>A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p>
          <h2>Personal information</h2>
          <p>This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Spectre, such as information we associate with your Spectre Account.</p>
          <h2>Sensitive personal information</h2>
          <p>This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.</p>
          <h2>Server logs</h2>
          <p>Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
          <p>A typical log entry for a Spectre user looks like this:</p>
          <p><span >123.45.67.89</span><span >- 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 - Spectre PE - Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 - 740674ce2123e969</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><span >123.45.67.89 </span>is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.</li>
            <li><span >25/Mar/2020 10:15:32 </span>is the date and time of access.</li>
            <li><span >Spectre PE </span>is the requested application, specifically the 'Spectre Post-Experience' app.</li>
            <li><span >Firefox 10.0.7; Windows NT 7.1 </span>is the browser and operating system being used.</li>
            <li><span >740674ce2123a969 </span>is the unique identifier assigned to this user the first time they visited Spectre. (Identifiers may be deleted by users. If the user has deleted their identifier since the last time they visited Spectre, then it will be re-assigned to their device the next time they visit Spectre.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Unique identifiers</h2>
          <p>A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>
          <p>Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser</p>
          <p>in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about <span >how Spectre uses cookies</span>.</p>
          <p>On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be <span >managed </span>in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>
