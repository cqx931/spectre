            <p >When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.</p>
            <p >This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.</p>
            <p >Effective October 15, 2019</p>
            <p ><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/archive">Archived versions</a></p>
            <p >We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:</p>
            <p >Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home</p>
            <p >Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system</p>
            <p >Products that are integrated into <nobr>third-party</nobr> apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps</p>
            <p >You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.</p>
            <p >To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms#key-terms"><span >key terms</span></a>.

            <p >We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services</p>
            <p >We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-people-online">language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, </a>and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.</p>
            <p ><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-unique-id">When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or </a><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-device">device </a><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-unique-id">you’re using. This helps us do things like </a>maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.</p>
            <p >When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-personal-info">personal information.</a></p>
            <p >Things you create or provide to us</p>
            <p >When you create a Google Account, you provide us with <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-personal-info">personal information </a>that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-phone-number">phone number </a>or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-payment-info">payment information </a>to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.</p>
            <p >We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.</p>

We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-ip">IP address, </a>crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.</p>
            <p >We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-android-device">Android device with Google apps, </a>your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.</p>
            <p >Your activity</p>
            <p >We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:</p>

            <p >Videos you watch</p>
            <p ><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-content-views">Views and interactions with content and ads</a></p>

            <p >If you use our <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-calls-messages">services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, </a>we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, <nobr>calling-party</nobr> number, <nobr>receiving-party</nobr> number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls.</p>

            <p >Your location information</p>
            <p >We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.</p>
            <p >Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:</p>
            <p >GPS</p>
            <p ><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-ip">IP address</a></p>

            <p >The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_location"><span >turn your Android device’s location on or off </span></a>using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_lochistory"><span >Location History </span></a>if you want to create a private map of where you go with your <nobr>signed-in</nobr> devices.</p>
            <p >In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-sources">publicly accessible sources. </a>For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-against-abuse">customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect </a><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-ad-services">against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.</a></p>
            <p >We use various technologies to collect and store information, including <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-cookies-and-similar-technologies">cookies, </a><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-pixel">pixel tags, </a>local storage, such as <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-browser-storage">browser web storage </a>or <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-application-data-cache">application data caches, </a>databases, and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-server-logs">server logs.</a></p>

          <p >We use data to build better services</p>
          <p >We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:</p>
          <p >Provide our services</p>
          <p >We use your information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-deliver-services">deliver our services, </a>like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.</p>
          <p >Maintain &amp; improve our services</p>
          <p >We also use your information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-ensure-working">ensure our services are working as intended, </a>such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-make-improvements">make improvements </a>to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve <nobr>spell-check</nobr> features used across our services.</p>
          <p >Develop new services</p>
          <p >We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</p>
          <p >Provide personalized services, including content and ads</p>
          <p >We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-customized-search">customized search results. </a>For example, <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?utm_source=pp"><span >Security Checkup </span></a>provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</p>
          <p >Depending on your settings, we may also show you <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-personalized-ads">personalized ads </a>based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.</p>
        </div>
        <div >
          <div >
            </div>
          <div >
            <p >We don’t show you personalized ads based on <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories, </a>such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</p>
            <p >We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</p>
            <p ><a href="https://adssettings.google.com/?utm_source=pp">Go to Ad Settings</a></p>
            <p >Measure performance</p>
            <p >We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-link-info">may link information </a>about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.</p>
            <p >Communicate with you</p>
            <p >We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</p>

          <div >
            <p >We use information to help improve the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-safety-reliability">safety and reliability </a>of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.</p>

            <p >We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-detect-abuse">detect abuse </a>such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-algorithm">algorithms </a>to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.</p>
            <p >We may <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-combine-info">combine the information we collect </a>among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy#footnote-other-sites">your activity on other sites and apps </a>may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.</p>
            <p >If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</p>
            <p >We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p >YOUR PRIVACY CONTROLS</p>
            <p >You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used</p>
            <p >This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/privacycheckup?utm_source=pp"><span >Privacy Checkup</span></a>, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/product-privacy"><span >Product Privacy Guide</span></a>.</p>

            <p >We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>

            <p >For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.</p>
            <p >We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_agereq&hl=en"><span >Learn more</span></a></p>

            <p >Views and interactions with content and ads</p>
            <p >For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.</p>

            <p >Sensor data from your device</p>
            <p >Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.</p>
            <p >Information about things near your device</p>
            <p >If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and <nobr>Wi-Fi</nobr> access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_androidloc&hl=en"><span >Learn more</span></a></p>

          <p >Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:</p>
          <p >We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video</p>
          <p >We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account</p>

          <p >When you purchase services or physical goods from us, you may provide us information like your shipping address or delivery instructions. We use this information for things like processing, fulfilling, and delivering your order, and to provide support in connection with the product or service you purchase.</p>
          <p >ensure our services are working as intended</p>
          <p >For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.</p>
          <p >make improvements</p>
          <p >For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</p>

          <p >personalized ads</p>
          <p >You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts?p=privpol_whyad&hl=en"><span >Learn more</span></a></p>
          <p >sensitive categories</p>
          <p >When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.

Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"><span >account settings </span></a>and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.</p>

            <p ><nobr>Non-personally</nobr> identifiable information</p>
            <p >This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually- identifiable user.</p>
            <p >IP address</p>
            <p >Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.</p>
            <p >Pixel tag</p>
            <p >A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.</p>

          <p >Server logs</p>
          <p >Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.</p>
          <p >A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:</p>

          <p ><span >123.45.67.89 </span>is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.</p>
          <p ><span >25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 </span>is the date and time of the query.</p>
          <p ><span >http://www.google.com/search?q=cars </span>is the requested URL, including the search query.</p>
          <p ><span >Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 </span>is the browser and operating system being used.</p>
          <p ><span >740674ce2123a969 </span>is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).</p>
          <p >Unique identifiers</p>
          <p >A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.</p>
          <p >Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser</p>

          <p >On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads"><span >managed </span></a>in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the <nobr>IMEI-number</nobr> of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.</p>
